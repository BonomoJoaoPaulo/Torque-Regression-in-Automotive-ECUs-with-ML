All the code is located in the /src folder.

The original code contained confidential information, such as variable names,
so we had to remove it from this public repository.

The code for misfire classification can be found at https://github.com/canalrafael/Misfire-Detection,
as it was part of a preview work.

Thank you for your understanding! :)
